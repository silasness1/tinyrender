Look I have no idea what I'm doing here but I'm carving my own workflow. 
I installed MingGW which is some kind of compiler.
So to get the program to run I type MingGW32-make which uses the makefile and then .\main.exe to get it to run 
aka produce the tga file. 

Okay changed makefile path in the make file extension so I can just run it from there. d

How to get debugger to work.
Also better understand makefiles now

GDB Notes: it turns out I had to add -g to the makefile 

Now I can use makefile tools as my main thing.
